# Recommending-and-ranking-resumes-
## Project overview
Implementation of an application for recommending and ranking profiles from Resumes database for HR recruitment needs.
Scraping, Data preparation, Analysis and Prediction.

The project consists in implementing IBM master plan steps in the standard data mining process
which aim to understanding the business and data, collecting and preparing data, extracting models which are then assessed to make sure that they fall in line with the business initiatives to extract useful information from it to do predictions. Our challenge
is to implement the application, which is a recommendation and
classification application for profiles of resumes database already created from WEB (from
LinkedIn) to speed up the HR recruitment process and propose relevant CVs according to the profile research.

According to IBM master plan methodology, a data science project begins with the most important chapter which is business understanding; doing the plan and strategy to respond to our main goals and meet the expectation of having significant results. Then, we have data collection, data understanding and data preparation in order to be ready for the modeling step. After modeling we have to evaluate our model before deployment of our application.
