# Recommending-and-ranking-resumes-
## Project overview
Implementation of an application for recommending and ranking profiles from Resumes database for HR recruitment needs.
Scraping, Data preparation, Analysis and Prediction.

The project consists in implementing IBM master plan steps in the standard data mining process
which aim to understanding the business and data, collecting and preparing data, extracting models which are then assessed to make sure that they fall in line with the business initiatives to extract useful information from it to do predictions. Our challenge
is to implement the application, which is a recommendation and
classification application for profiles of resumes database already created from WEB (from
LinkedIn) to speed up the HR recruitment process and propose relevant CVs according to the profile research.

According to IBM master plan methodology, a data science project begins with the most important chapter which is business understanding; doing the plan and strategy to respond to our main goals and meet the expectation of having significant results. Then, we have data collection, data understanding and data preparation in order to be ready for the modeling step. After modeling we have to evaluate our model before deployment of our application.</br>

#### BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING AND DATA ANALYTICS
The first stage of the IBM master plan process is to understand what we want to accom-
plish from a business prespective. Our organization may have competing objectives and

constraints that must be properly balanced. The goal of this stage of the process is to
uncover important factors that could influence the project outcome because neglecting
this step can mean that a great deal of effort is put into producing the right answers to
the wrong questions.
### BUSINESS OBJECTIVES
In our project the business objectives that we will define are implementation of a recommendation and classification application for profiles of a Resumes database in order to speed up the HR recruitment process and to propose relevant resumes according to the profile sought by
the recruitment manager. In other words, the creation of a recommendation system for the purpose of optimizing recruitment, that is to say providing the profile that matches the profile sought. The tool allows the filtering and classification of profiles according to the position requested (diplomas, skills, seniority, place of residence, etc.). This application allows increasing overall revenue by ensuring a gain in terms of search time and gain
in terms of number of HR agents responsible for recruitment. Also we need a strategic dashboard that helps the HR manager to make strategic decisions.

### DATA SCIENCE OBJECTIVES
The principal purpose of data science is to find patterns within data. It uses various
statistical techniques to analyze and draw insights from the data. From data extraction,
wrangling and pre-processing, a data scientist must scrutinize the data thoroughly. Then,

we have the responsibility of making predictions from the data. The goal of a Data Sci-
entist is to derive conclusions from the data. Through these conclusions, we are able to

assist companies in making smarter business decisions.
In this project our data science objectives are defined below:
